Linked lists
============

This is data structure that take advantage of references. Linked lists are made up of nodes. Each
node contains reference to the next node in the list. What is more, each node contains a data.

A linked list is:

* the empty lists, represented by None
* a node that contains data object and a reference to a linked list

# Pseudocode

```
structure node:
  next_node = none
  data = none
  
structure linked_list:
  length = 0
  head = none
```
